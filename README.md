# spatio-spectral-imaging
jupyter notebook for analyzing spatio-spectral imaging data from AFM scan

Reads a data file output from Lightfield program with Wavelength and Intensities for each spectrum as columns. Separates this data into forward and reverse scan information, plots example spectra from scan, and images with the binned intensities at each pixel. Also allows viewing and Lorentzian fitting of each spectra and plots images containing the values for the fit Intensities, Peak Positions, and Peak Widths.
